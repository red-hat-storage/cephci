"""
Provides the necessary interfaces to interact with IBM Cloud Object Storage.

The purpose of this module is to enable RH Ceph QE team access to various development
builds (mainly RPMs).

This module depends on the availability of `cos` section in CephCI's global config file.
The required keys in the `cos` section are
    - endpoint
    - api-key
    - resource-id
    - location-constraint

Currently, the below methods are available for use
    # upload
    # upload_directory
    # download
    # download_directory
    # create_bucket
    # bucket_exists
    # set_lifecycle_rules

This module requires the below configuration information in CephCI config file.
cos:
  api-key: <service-or-user-api-key>
  endpoint: <resource-public-endpoint>
  resource-id: <deployed-instance-resource-id>
  location-constraint: <storage-class>
