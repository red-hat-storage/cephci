# Tier2: Extended RBD acceptance testing
#
# This test suite runs addition test scripts to evaluate the existing functionality of
# Ceph RBD component.
#
# Cluster Configuration:
#    Conf file - conf/squid/rbd/4-node-cluster-with-1-client.yaml
#    Node 2 must to be a client node
#
# The following tests are covered
#   - CEPH-9230 - verification snap and clone on an imported image
#   - CEPH-11408 - If the image has an exclusive-lock on it, verify the behaviour on delayed deletion
#   - CEPH-11409 - Delayed Deletion - Create a clone of a RBD image, and then try to delete the parent image while the relationship is active
#   - CEPH-83573309 - Verify deletion of parent Image when clone is flattened
#   - CEPH-83573650 - Create image with Deep Flattening enabled,take snap,protect,clone,snap,flatten the clone, unprotect the parent snap, delete the parent snap
#   - CEPH-9833 - Create multiple snapshot from Parent and its clone Image, rename all the snapshot one-by-one
#   - CEPH-9835 - Create multiple snapshot, on top create clone image, then try to rename the snapshot which hosts the clone (Negative)
#   - CEPH-9836 - [Rbd] - Rename the snapshot when different operations on the clone/parent image is in progress
#   - CEPH-9224 - RBD-Kernel_Client: Try to delete a protected snapshot
#   - CEPH-9862 - Perform flatten operations while changing the image feature
#   - CEPH-9861 - Perform resize operations while changing the image feature
#   - CEPH-83574644 - set "rbd_compression_hint" globally, per-pool, or per-image and check the behaviour
