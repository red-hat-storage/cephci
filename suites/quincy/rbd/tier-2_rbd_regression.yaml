# Tier2: Extended RBD acceptance testing
#
# This test suite runs addition test scripts to evaluate the existing functionality of
# Ceph RBD component.
#
# Cluster Configuration:
#    Conf file - conf/quincy/rbd/4-node-cluster-with-1-client.yaml
#    Node 2 must to be a client node
#
# The following tests are covered
#   - CEPH-9230 - verification snap and clone on an imported image
#   - CEPH-83573308, CEPH-83573307 - clones creation with v2clone format and deletion
#   - CEPH-83573297 - Check trash if the deleted images are moved to trash automatically
