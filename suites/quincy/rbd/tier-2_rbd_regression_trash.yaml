# Tier2: Extended RBD acceptance testing
#
# This test suite runs addition test scripts to evaluate the existing functionality of
# Ceph RBD component.
#
# Cluster Configuration:
#    Conf file - conf/quincy/rbd/4-node-cluster-with-1-client.yaml
#    Node 2 must to be a client node
#
# The following tests are covered
#   - CEPH-83573297 - Enable "rbd_move_to_trash_on_remove" config setting, delete images and check if they are moved to trash automatically
#   - CEPH-83573296 - Disable "rbd_move_to_trash_on_remove" config setting, delete images and check if they are not moved to trash automatically
#   - CEPH-83573289 - Move images to trash, apply force remove on some of the images and check them
#   - CEPH-83573298 - Move images to trash, undo them and verify the data which was created previously in it
#   - CEPH-11413 - Delayed Deletion - In a time based deletion, restore an image which is marked for deletion. Verify if this image can be used as a normal image after. Create snaps on it, and clones from it
#   - CEPH-11414 - In a parent clone relationship, move parent image to trash. Dont sever the child image from parent, but try to restore the parent, and verify the clone relationship is intact
#   - CEPH-11415 - Delayed Deletion - Enable the image features on image, and mark for deletion. Now try to enable disable features
#   - CEPH-11393 - Delayed Deletion - Verify there is no name collision with a trashed image
