# Rationale for 11 node cluster.
# Requirement for stretch Cluster Deployment.
# We need 5 distinct nodes for mon daemons. ( Stretch cluster needs 2 mons in each site, and 1 as Arbiter)
# OSD's can only communicate with Mons of their site, so collocating OSD's with mons might create issues,
# with stretch deployment. Also there needs to be sufficient OSD's for the 2 sites,
# Min 5 distinct OSD's nodes needed.
# The client is located on independently. 1 node.
