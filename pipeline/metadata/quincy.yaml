#=====================================================================================
# Metadata file for quincy upstream testing.
# Single file to specify test suites to be executed for all regression (sanity) and schedule tests
# as per defined in each stages.
# Each stage will execute in sequential pattern.
# Contains all Default parameter used for Execution when no override is specified.
# parameter required to create a similar custom file is suite name, suite yaml file, global configuration file,
# platform, rhbuild, inventory and metadata information like frequency of execution, tier, cloud type, functional group and stage.
