    This module verifies trash operations

    Args:
        kw: test data

    Returns:
        int: The return value. 0 for success, 1 otherwise

    Pre-requisites :
    We need atleast one client node with ceph-common package,
    conf and keyring files

    Test cases covered -
    1) CEPH-83573297 - Enable "rbd_move_to_trash_on_remove" config setting, delete images
    and check if they are moved to trash automatically.
    Test Case Flow
    1. Create a pool and an Image
    2. generate IO in images
    3. Enable "rbd_move_to_trash_on_remove" in client config
    4. Delete images and verify the deleted images are moved to trash automatically.


    2) CEPH-83573296 - Disable "rbd_move_to_trash_on_remove" config setting, delete images
    and check if they are not moved to trash automatically.
    Test case Flow
    1. Create a pool and an Image
    2. generate IO in images
