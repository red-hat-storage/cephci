    """Verify that clones can be created without protecting snapshot(v2clone).

    This module verifies snapshot and cloning operations with using snapshot protect having v2 clone enabled

    Args:
        kw: test data

    Returns:
        int: The return value. 0 for success, 1 otherwise

    Test case covered -
    CEPH-83573308 - Verify that clones can be created without protecting snapshot
    CEPH-83573307 - Delete parent snapshot and verify whether it is moved to trash or not.
    CEPH-83573309 - Verify deletion of parent Image when clone is flattened.
    Pre-requisites :
    1. Cluster must be up and running with capacity to create pool
       (At least with 64 pgs)
    2. We need atleast one client node with ceph-common package,
       conf and keyring files

    Test Case Flow:
    1. Create a pool and an Image
    2. Create snapshot for Image
    3. make v2clone default  - ceph osd set-require-min-compat-client mimic
    4. Create clone for an image which is having snapshots
    5. Remove parent image snapshot and check the status
    6. Flattened the clone and check the trash views
