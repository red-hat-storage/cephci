"""Module to verify disable image feature with meta-data set on image.

Pre-requisites :
We need cluster configured with atleast one client node with ceph-common package,
conf and keyring files

Test case covered -
CEPH-9864 - Disable some existing Image Feature on Image having metadata set on it,
with IO in progress from Client Side

Test Case Flow:
1. Create a Replicated pool
2. Create an image
3. Run Ios on an Image
4. Set image meta on the image
5. verify that image meta is set properly.
6. Initiate IOs from client
7. While running the IOs disable the existing image feature.
8. Image features should be disable properly
8. Repeat steps 1 to 7 for ecpool
