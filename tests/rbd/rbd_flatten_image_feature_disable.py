    Test Case Flow:
    1. Create a pool
    2. Create an image
    3. Run Ios on an Image
    4. Take a snapshot
    5. Protect a snapshot
    6. clone a snapshot
    7. While changing the image features, perform flatten operations
        Image features should be changed and flatten operation should succeed
    8. Repeat steps 1 to 7 for ecpool
