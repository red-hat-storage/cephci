    Pre-requisites :
    1. At least two clusters must be up and running with enough number of OSDs to create pools
    2. We need atleast one client node with ceph-common package,
       conf and keyring files
    Test Case Flow:
    1. Create an image in primary and perform IOs.
    2. enable pool mirroring on the image.
    3. verify for the pool mirror mode enabled on secondary.
    4. Move the secondary image to the trash.
    6. verify that unable to mark the secondary image for deletion, as image is locked.
