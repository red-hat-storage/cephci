"""
Module to verify Ceph Manager Failover functionality and ensure system stability
during continuous failover cycles. This test also checks for defunct SSH processes
after each failover and applies a workaround if needed (for Pacific release).
The test is designed to run continuously through multiple failover cycles and ensure
the robustness of the Ceph Manager failover process, as well as system stability with
respect to SSH process management.
This test is particularly useful for validating that Ceph Manager failover does not
leave lingering issues such as defunct SSH processes or abnormal system behavior.
