Tier-2 test to ensure PG deep-scrub does not report inconsistent PGs
when radosgw bilog trimming occurs on PGs where secondary OSD is down
Customer Bug: 2056818 - [GSS][RADOS][RGW] Scrub errors (omap_digest_mismatch) on
PGs of RGW metadata pools after upgrade to RHCS 5

Test needs to run as part of rgw/tier-2_rgw_rados_multisite_ecpool.yaml
as it needs a rgw multisite setup along with data present in RGW pools

    # CEPH-83575437

    This test is to verify no issues are observed during deep-scrub when rgw bilog
    trimming occurs with OSD down
    Steps:
    Ref:
    - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2056818#c42
    - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2056818#c50
    1. Deploy minimal RGW multisite setup
    2. Add data to both the sites in S3 buckets and let the minimal client IO running
    3. Keep running the deep-scrub for index pool PGs
    4. Set noout flag
    5. stop the secondary OSD on the primary site(site1)
    6. run the following command
       radosgw-admin bilog autotrim
    7. Once the above command finishes, start the primary OSD that was stopped in step 4
    8. Retrigger the deep-scrub for eight PGs in index pool
