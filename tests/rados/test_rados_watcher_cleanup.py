Test Case: Verify RBD Watchers are Properly Cleaned Up

Workflow:
1. Create Watchers:
   - Input: List of image names, client node object(s)
   - Action: Map images to clients (single or multiple)
   - Validation: Confirm watchers are created

2. Delete Watchers:
   - Input: Cleanup method, mapping info from previous step
   - Supported Methods:
       a. unmap
       b. umount
       c. blacklist
       d. restart
       e. crash
   - Validation: Confirm watchers are removed

Approach 1: Single client
Approach 2: Multiple clients

    CEPH-83616882: Verify RBD Watchers are Properly Cleaned Up.
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2336352

    This test case validates comprehensive watcher cleanup for RBD images
    across single and multiple client scenarios using various methods.

    Workflow:
    1.  Create Pool: Establishes a dedicated test pool.
    2.  Create RBD Images: Generates images for single and multi-client tests.
    3.  Create Watchers: Maps images to clients, validating watcher creation.
    4.  Delete Watchers (Phase 2): Applies various cleanup methods (unmap, umount,
        restart, crash) and confirms watcher removal for specific images/clients.
    5.  Delete Watchers (Phase 3 - Blacklist): Dedicated test for blacklist method.
    6.  Final Cleanup: Ensures all test-related resources are removed.

    Args:
        ceph_cluster (CephCluster): The Ceph cluster object.
        **kw: Keyword arguments for test configuration.
              Examples:
                - config:
                    Single_Client_watcher: true
                    pool_name: my_test_pool
                - config:
                    Multiple_Client_watcher: true
                    pool_name: another_pool

    Returns:
        int: 0 if the test passes, 1 if it fails.
