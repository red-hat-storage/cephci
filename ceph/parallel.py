"""
This module provides a context manager for running methods concurrently.

For backward compatability, spawn method is leveraged however one can also
choose to move submit. Likewise, thread pool executor is the default executor.

Timeout is an inherited feature provided by concurrent futures. Additionally,
one wait for all the threads/process to complete even when on thread or process
encounters an exception. This is useful when multiple test modules are
executing different test scenarios.

When a test module controls the threads then it can forcefully terminate all
threads when an exception is encountered.

Changelog:
    Version 1.0 used gevent module for parallel method execution.
    Version 2.0 uses concurrent.futures module instead of gevent.

You add functions to be run with the spawn method::

    with parallel() as p:
        for foo in bar:
            p.spawn(quux, foo, baz=True)

You can iterate over the results (which are in arbitrary order)::

    with parallel() as p:
        for foo in bar:
            p.spawn(quux, foo, baz=True)
        for result in p:
            print result

In version 2, you can choose whether to use threads or processes by

    with parallel(thread_pool=False, timeout=10) as p:
        _r = [p.spawn(quux, x) for name in names]

If one of the spawned functions throws an exception, it will be thrown
when iterating over the results, or when the with block ends.

At the end of the with block, the main thread waits until all
spawned functions have completed, or, if one exited with an exception,
kills the rest and raises the exception.
